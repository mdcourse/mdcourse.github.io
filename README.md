# Learn Molecular Simulations with Python

The goal of [Learn Molecular Simulations with Python](https://mdcourse.github.io/) is to write a simple code containing most of the basic functionalities of molecular simulations, including molecular
dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations.

The target audience is people either completely new to molecular simulations, or users of user-friendly
codes such as LAMMPS and GROMACS wanting to better understand what is hiding behind those codes.

The Python code that will be written here will be used to realize some simple scientific projects. Note that the code is slow and that efficiency is not the objective of the present project.

Although some basic knowledge in coding, thermodynamics, and statistical physics is recommended to fully understand molecular simulations, Learning molecular simulations with Python can be followed even without deep knowledge in those fields. Annexes with key concepts and suggested readings are given when necessary.

### What is not in the code (yet)

- molecules
- thermostats and barostats other than Berendsen
- energy minimization methods other than the steepest descent
- non-cubic boxes
