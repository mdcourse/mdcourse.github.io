By following Learn Molecular Simulations with Python, you will write a simple Python
code containing the most basic functionalities of molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo
simulations. The main goal is to help users understand the basics of molecular simulation
algorithms.

In a second part of the project, the scripts will be used for small scientific
projects. In particular, some of the earliest results obtained by molecular
simulations, including the pioneering works by Metropolis, Rosenbluth,
Wood, and Parker in the 50s, will be re-explored. For instance, the movie on the right
shows the Monte Carlo simulation of a Lennard-Jones fluid made by Wood
and Parker :cite:`woodMonteCarloEquation1957`, see :ref:`project1-label`.

Prerequisites
-------------

This course is designed for complete beginners in molecular simulations,
as well as for those familiar with black-box software like LAMMPS and GROMACS.
Although some prior knowledge of coding and statistical physics would be useful, 
Learn Molecular Simulations with Python can be followed by anyone with a computer.
