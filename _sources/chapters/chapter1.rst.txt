Start coding
============

Presentation
------------

To perform the molecular simulations, three key steps will be followed:

1. **System Initialization:** This step involves creating the simulation box,
   placing the atoms, and selecting the parameters for their interactions.
  
2. **Energy Minimization:** An energy minimization of the system will be
   carried out to position the atoms in reasonable relative locations and
   reduce the system's energy.
  
3. **Execution of the Main Algorithm:** The main algorithm, either Monte Carlo
   or molecular dynamics, will then be executed.

In addition to these three key steps, some supplementary tasks will be
performed, such as non-dimensionalizing units, measuring data, and outputting
thermodynamic information during the simulation.

List of Files

Potential for inter-atomic interaction
--------------------------------------

In molecular simulations, potential functions are used to mimic the interaction
between atoms. Although more complicated options exist, potentials are usually
defined as functions of the distance :math:`r` between two atoms.

Within a dedicated folder, create the first file named *potentials.py*. This
file will contain a function called *potentials*. Two types of potential can 
be returned by this function: the Lennard-Jones potential (LJ), and the
hard-sphere potential.

Copy the following lines into *potentials.py*:

.. label:: start_potentials_class

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np

    def potentials(potential_type, epsilon, sigma, r, derivative=False):
        if potential_type == "Lennard-Jones":
            if derivative:
                return 48 * epsilon * ((sigma / r) ** 12 - 0.5 * (sigma / r) ** 6) / r
            else:
                return 4 * epsilon * ((sigma / r) ** 12 - (sigma / r) ** 6)
        elif potential_type == "Hard-Sphere":
            if derivative:
                # Derivative is not defined for Hard-Sphere potential.
                # --> return 0
                return np.zeros(len(r))
            else:
                return np.where(r > sigma, 0, 1000)
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"Unknown potential type: {potential_type}")

.. label:: end_potentials_class

The hard-sphere potential either returns a value of 0 when the distance between
the two particles is larger than the parameter, :math:`r > \sigma`, or 1000 when
:math:`r < \sigma`. The value of *1000* was chosen to be large enough to ensure
that any Monte Carlo move that would lead to the two particles to overlap will
be rejected.

In the case of the LJ potential, depending on the value of the optional
argument *derivative*, which can be either *False* or *True*, the *LJ_potential*
function will return the force:

.. math::

    F_\text{LJ} = 48 \dfrac{\epsilon}{r} \left[ \left( \frac{\sigma}{r} \right)^{12} - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{\sigma}{r} \right)^6 \right],

or the potential energy:

.. math::

    U_\text{LJ} = 4 \epsilon \left[ \left( \frac{\sigma}{r} \right)^{12} - \left( \frac{\sigma}{r} \right)^6 \right].

Create the Classes
------------------

Let's create the files with the minimal information about the classes and
their inheritance. The classes will be developed progressively in the
following chapters.

The first class is the *Prepare* class, which will be used for the
nondimensionalization of the parameters. In the same folder as *potentials.py*,
create the *Prepare.py* file and copy the following lines into it:

.. label:: start_Prepare_class

.. code-block:: python

    class Prepare:
        def __init__(self,
                    *args,
                    **kwargs):
            super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)

.. label:: end_Prepare_class

The second class is named *Utilities*. Within the *Utilities.py* file,
copy the following lines:

.. label:: start_Utilities_class

.. code-block:: python

    from potentials import potentials


    class Utilities:
        def __init__(self,
                    *args,
                    **kwargs):
            super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)

.. label:: end_Utilities_class

The line *from potentials import LJ_potential* is used to import the
*LJ_potential* function.

Within the *InitializeSimulation.py* file, copy the following lines:

.. label:: start_InitializeSimulation_class

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    from Prepare import Prepare


    class InitializeSimulation(Prepare):
        def __init__(self,
                    *args,
                    **kwargs,
                    ):
            super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)

.. label:: end_InitializeSimulation_class

The *InitializeSimulation* class inherits from the previously created
*Prepare* class. Additionally, we anticipate that *NumPy* will be required.

Within the *Measurements.py* file, copy the following lines:

.. label:: start_Measurements_class

.. code-block:: python

    from InitializeSimulation import InitializeSimulation
    from Utilities import Utilities


    class Measurements(InitializeSimulation, Utilities):
        def __init__(self,
                    *args,
                    **kwargs):
            super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
          
.. label:: end_Measurements_class

The *Measurements* class inherits both the *InitializeSimulation* and
*Utilities* classes. 

Finally, let us create the three remaining classes, named *MinimizeEnergy*,
*MonteCarlo*, and *MolecularDynamics*. Each of these three classes inherits
from the *Measurements* class, and thus from the classes inherited by
*Measurements*. Within the *MinimizeEnergy.py* file, copy the following lines:

.. label:: start_MinimizeEnergy_class

.. code-block:: python

    from Measurements import Measurements
    import os


    class MinimizeEnergy(Measurements):
        def __init__(self,
                    *args,
                    **kwargs):
            super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)

.. label:: end_MinimizeEnergy_class

We anticipate that the *os* module, which provides a way to interact with the
operating system, will be required :cite:`Rossum2009Python3`.

Within the *MonteCarlo.py* file, copy the following lines:

.. label:: start_MonteCarlo_class

.. code-block:: python

    from scipy import constants as cst
    import numpy as np
    import copy
    import os
    from Measurements import Measurements

    import warnings
    warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')


    class MonteCarlo(Measurements):
        def __init__(self,
                    *args,
                    **kwargs):
            super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)

.. label:: end_MonteCarlo_class

Several libraries were imported, namely *Constants* from *SciPy*, *NumPy*, *copy*
and *os*.

The *warnings* was placed to avoid the anoying message "*RuntimeWarning: overflow
encountered in exp*" that is sometimes triggered by the exponential of the
*acceptation_probability* (see :ref:`chapter6-label`).

Finally, within the *MolecularDynamics.py* file, copy the following lines:

.. label:: start_MolecularDynamics_class

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    from Measurements import Measurements


    class MolecularDynamics(Measurements):
        def __init__(self,
                    *args,
                    **kwargs,
                    ):
            super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)

.. label:: end_MolecularDynamics_class

Test the code
-------------

We can create simple tests to ensure that the classes are inherited as
expected. Within the same folder, create a new Python file called *test_1a.py*,
and copy the following lines into it:

.. label:: start_test_1a_class

.. code-block:: python

    # Import the required modules
    from Utilities import Utilities
    from MonteCarlo import MonteCarlo

    # Make sure that MonteCarlo correctly inherits from Utilities
    def test_montecarlo_inherits_from_utilities():
        assert issubclass(MonteCarlo, Utilities), "MonteCarlo should inherit from Utilities"
        print("MonteCarlo correctly inherits from Utilities")

    # Make sure that Utilities does not inherit from MonteCarlo
    def test_utilities_does_not_inherit_from_montecarlo():
        assert not issubclass(Utilities, MonteCarlo), "Utilities should not inherit from MonteCarlo"
        print("Utilities does not inherit from MonteCarlo, as expected")

    # In the script is launched with Python, call Pytest
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        import pytest
        pytest.main(["-s", __file__])

.. label:: end_test_1a_class

When run with Python, this script should return the following messages without
any *AssertionError*:

.. code-block:: bw

    Utilities does not inherit from MonteCarlo, as expected
    MonteCarlo correctly inherits from Utilities

Alternatively, this test can also be launched using Pytest by typing in a terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest .

We can also test that calling the *__init__*
method of the *MonteCarlo* class does not return any error. In new Python file
called *test_1b.py*, copy the following lines:

.. label:: start_test_1b_class

.. code-block:: python

    # Import the MonteCarlo class
    from MonteCarlo import MonteCarlo

    # Define a function that try to call the *__init__()* method
    def test_init_method():
        try:
            MonteCarlo().__init__()  # Call the method
            print("Method call succeeded")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Method call raised an error: {e}")

    # In the script is launched with Python, call Pytest
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        import pytest
        pytest.main(["-s", __file__])

.. label:: end_test_1b_class

Running this second test with Python should return "Method call succeeded".
